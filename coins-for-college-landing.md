## FOR STUDENTS — MINING PROGRAM

### Secure Early Supporter Status

**How Mining Works**  
Log in daily to start a 24-hour mining cycle. Earn virtual tokens for up to 10 colleges before they officially launch. Invite peers for mining bonuses.

**Token Release Mechanism**  
When your college joins Coins For College and goes live, your mined balance converts to real tokens. The ratio depends on what the college allocates to early supporters versus total tokens mined.

**Fallback Value Protection**  
If a college hasn't joined after 1 year, surrender your mined tokens for TUIT (Collegen's native token). Exchange rate calculated at time of surrender based on TUIT market value and college tier.

**Requirements Before Release**  
- KYC verification  
- Proof of association with the college (student ID, enrollment records, alumni documentation)
- Cannot mine for the same college again after surrender
